## Topics Covered

- **Arrays and Strings**: Basic operations, sorting, and searching algorithms.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, and circular linked lists with various operations.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Implementation and applications.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, and tree traversals.
- **Graphs**: Representations, traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford).
- **Hashing**: Hash tables, collision resolution techniques.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort, heap sort, and more.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Fibonacci, knapsack problem, longest common subsequence, and other classic problems.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Huffman coding, activity selection, and more.
- **Backtracking**: N-Queens problem, Sudoku solving, subset sum problem, and other puzzles.
